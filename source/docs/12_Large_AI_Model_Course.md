* **Overview of Large Language Model**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed to comprehend and generate human language.

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.1/01/image2.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(1) Basic Concept

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on extensive text data, designed to either generate natural language text or comprehend the meaning of language. LLM is capable of performing various natural language tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and dialogue, making them a crucial step toward achieving advanced artificial intelligence. Unlike smaller models, LLM leverages a similar Transformer architecture and pretraining objectives (like Language Modeling), but are distinguished by their larger model size, greater training data, and enhanced computational resources.

(2) Features

**Massive Scale:** LLM are characterized by their vast parameter sizes, often reaching billions or even trillions of parameters. This immense scale allows them to capture a wealth of linguistic knowledge and complex syntactic structures.

**Pretraining and Fine-tuning:** LLM utilize a two-stage learning process: pretraining and fine-tuning. Initially, they are pretrained on large-scale, unlabeled text data, learning general language representations and knowledge. Subsequently, they are fine-tuned using labeled data to specialize in specific tasks, allowing them to excel across a wide range of NLP applications.

**Contextual Awareness:** LLM demonstrate exceptional contextual awareness, with their ability to understand and generate language deeply dependent on preceding text. This enables them to perform exceptionally well in tasks like dialogue, article generation, and contextual comprehension.

**Multilingual Capabilities:** LLM support multiple languages, extending beyond just English. This multilingual proficiency enables them to power cross-lingual and cross-cultural applications, enhancing their versatility and global reach.

**Multimodal Support:** Some LLMs have expanded to handle multimodal data, including text, images, and speech. This capability allows them to understand and generate content across various media types, opening up more diverse application possibilities.

**Emergent Properties:** LLM exhibit remarkable emergent properties, where performance improvements become apparent in large models but are absent in smaller ones. This makes them adept at handling more complex tasks and challenges.

**Cross-domain Applications:** LLM have been widely adopted across numerous fields, including text generation, machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Their influence is profound, impacting both daily life and work in significant ways.

**Ethical and Risk Considerations:** While LLM showcase impressive capabilities, they also raise important ethical and risk-related concerns, such as the potential generation of harmful content, privacy violations, and cognitive biases. As such, the development and deployment of LLM must be approached with careful consideration and caution.

(3) Working Principle

Large Language Model (LLM) are built on deep learning principles and are trained using massive datasets and substantial computational resources to develop neural networks with billions of parameters. Through iterative training and parameter optimization, these models learn to perform a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. The "**large**" in LLM reflects their immense scale—encompassing a vast number of parameters, extensive training data, and significant computational demands. This scale enables advanced models to achieve superior generalization capabilities and deliver increasingly accurate results, even in highly specialized domains.

Today, some of the most popular applications revolve around generative AI, such as language generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and image generation platforms (e.g., Midjourney). At the core of these applications is the concept of generation—the model's ability to predict and produce coherent content based on a given input.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Text Generation

Large Language Models are capable of generating diverse types of text, including news articles, stories, poems, and more. These capabilities make them well-suited for applications in content creation, creative writing, and automated storytelling.

② Text Classification

Large Language Models can classify text into various categories, such as sentiment analysis and topic identification. These capabilities are especially valuable in scenarios like public opinion analysis, information retrieval, and content moderation.

③  Machine Translation

Large Language Models excel at machine translation, enabling the conversion of text from one language to another. These capabilities are essential for cross-language communication, localization, and global collaboration.

④ Question-Answering Systems

Large Language Models can be used to build question-answering systems that respond to user queries. These applications are particularly valuable in areas such as intelligent customer support, knowledge retrieval, and information lookup.

### 12.1.2 Large Speech Model Courses

* **Overview of Large Speech Model**

(1) What is a Large Speech Model?

A Speech Large Model (LSM) refers to a machine learning model that uses deep learning techniques to process and understand speech data. These models can be applied in a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, and emotional analysis of speech. The design and training of these models typically require large amounts of speech data and substantial computational resources, which is why they are referred to as "**large models**".

(2) Why Do We Need Large Speech Model?

With the advancement of artificial intelligence and deep learning, traditional speech processing methods face many limitations. Large models leverage vast amounts of data and deep neural networks to learn and understand the complex features within speech, thereby improving the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and generation.

Their advantages include:

① High Accuracy: They maintain a high recognition rate even in noisy environments and with various accents.

② Naturalness: Speech generated by synthesis models is more natural, closely resembling human speech.

③ Versatility: These models support a wide range of languages and tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and emotion recognition.

(3) Development of Speech Recognition Technology

Word-Level Speech Recognition: At this stage, speech recognition systems could only recognize individual words

Phrase-Level Speech Recognition: With the expansion of data and advancements in algorithms, speech recognition systems gradually gained the ability to recognize longer phrases, such as "**Please turn on my computer**".

Sentence-Level Speech Recognition: In recent years, with the emergence of AI large models, speech recognition systems have become capable of recognizing entire sentences and understanding their underlying meaning.

(4) Differences Between Large Speech Model and Traditional Speech Processing Technologies

① Processing Methods

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically rely on manual feature extraction and shallow models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to process speech signals.

Large Speech Model: These use end-to-end learning, directly mapping raw speech waveforms to target outputs (such as text or another speech signal), reducing the reliance on manual feature extraction. They are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers.

② Model Complexity

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These models are relatively simple, with fewer parameters.

Large Speech Model: These models have complex structures and a large number of parameters, enabling them to capture more subtle speech features and contextual information.

③ Recognition Capability

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These are highly adaptable to specific scenarios and conditions, but their recognition capability is limited when encountering new, unseen data.

Large Speech Model: Due to their large number of parameters and powerful learning ability, they offer superior recognition capabilities and can adapt to a wider variety of speech data and environments.

④Training Data Requirements

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically require less data for training, but the data must be highly annotated and of high quality.

Large Speech Model: These require vast amounts of training data to fully learn the complexities of speech, often necessitating large quantities of annotated data or the use of unsupervised/self-supervised learning methods.

(5) Core Technologies of Speech Large Model

① Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR is the technology that converts human speech into text. The core steps of a speech recognition system include feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language modeling.

② Text-to-Speech (TTS)

TTS is the technology that converts text into speech. Common speech synthesis models include the Tacotron series, FastSpeech, and VITS.

③ Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction

Speech enhancement techniques are used to improve the quality of speech signals, typically for eliminating background noise and echoes. This is crucial for speech recognition applications in noisy environments.

(6) Applications of Speech Large Model

Intelligent Voice Assistants: For instance, Amazon Alexa and Google Home, which engage with users through voice interactions.

Customer Service Chatbots: In the customer service sector, speech large models assist businesses in enhancing service efficiency by swiftly processing customer inquiries through speech recognition technology, enabling 24/7 support.

Healthcare: Helping doctors with medical record-keeping, thus improving work efficiency.

Speech-to-Text: Speech large models excel in converting speech to text, offering accurate recognition and transcription in a variety of contexts. They are widely used in applications such as meeting transcription and subtitle generation.

To proceed, we need to identify the USB device name assigned to the connected WonderEcho Pro or voice device (hereafter referred to as the voice device). Please follow the steps below carefully. 

> [!NOTE]
> 
>Do not connect any other USB devices during this process to avoid confusion.

① First, disconnect the voice device, then open a terminal and run the following command:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

② Next, reconnect the voice device to the USB port on your main board and run the same command again:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

③ You should now see a newly listed USB port, such as ttyCH341USB1.  

Please take note of this device name—it may vary depending on the main controller being used.

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image3.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Wake-Up Test：

① To begin, update the port number used in the program by editing the script. You'll also need to uncomment the line for the port you're using and comment out any unused ports.

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

Press i to enter edit mode and make the necessary changes as shown below (update the port number accordingly and adjust comments as needed).

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image4.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Once the changes are complete, press ESC, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit the editor.

② Next, return to the system interface and run the wake-up demo using the command below. Speak the wake word **"HELLO HIWONDER"** clearly toward the WonderEcho Pro voice device.  

If the output includes **"keyword detect"**, it indicates that the firmware has been successfully flashed and the wake word is functioning correctly.

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image5.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(2) 6-Microphone Circular Array

As with the WonderEcho Pro, you can connect the 6-Microphone Circular Array to your main board (Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson) using a Type-C to USB cable.

Device Check:

For Jetson users, connect to the Jetson system using the NoMachine remote access tool. Once connected, check the desktop interface.  

If the 6-Microphone Circular Array icon appears on the left side of the desktop, it indicates the device has been successfully recognized.

Wake-Up Test:

① Open a new terminal window and run the following command to edit the wakeup_demo.py script:

```
vim ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter edit mode.

③ Update the port to match the device port number you previously identified. Comment out the WonderEcho Pro configuration (add \# at the beginning of the corresponding line), and uncomment the line using the voice device on line 11 as the input device (see red box in the referenced image).

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image7.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

④ Press ESC to return to command mode, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit.

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image8.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

⑤ In the terminal, run the wake-up program with the following command:

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

⑥ After about 30 seconds of initialization, speak the wake word **"hello hiwonder"** to test the device.

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/03/image10.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(3) Brief Program Overview

This is a Python-based wake word detection script that utilizes the speech module to process audio input and detect a specific wake word (e.g., "**HELLO_HIWONDER**").

Source Code Path: `/home/ubuntu/large_models/wakeup_demo.py`

Importing Required Modules

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from speech import awake
```

`os`: Used for handling file paths and executing system-level commands.

`time`: Provides delay functions to prevent overly frequent detection attempts.

`speech`: The core module responsible for processing audio input and detecting the wake word.

Initializing the wonderecho Class

{lineno-start=9}

```
port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
kws = awake.WonderEchoPro(port)
```

Attempts to Turn Off the Cooling Fan on Raspberry Pi 5

{lineno-start=13}

```
try:  # If a fan is present, it's recommended to turn it off before detection to reduce interference(如果有风扇，检测前推荐关掉减少干扰)
    os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh')
except:
    pass
```

Purpose: Attempts to turn off the cooling fan by executing the system command `pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh`. This helps minimize background noise from the fan that could interfere with wake word detection.

Error Handling: If the command fails (e.g., due to unsupported hardware), the program catches the exception and continues running without interruption.

Main Wake Word Detection Loop

{lineno-start=18}

```
kws.start() # Start detection(开始检测)
print('start...')
```

The program starts the wake word detection thread using kws.start().

It prints start... to indicate that detection has been successfully initiated.

Main Program Logic

{lineno-start=20}

```
while True:
    try:
        if kws.wakeup(): # Wake-up detected(检测到唤醒)
            print('hello hiwonder')
        time.sleep(0.02)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        kws.exit() # Cancel processing (关闭处理)
        try:
            os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
        except:
            pass
        break
```

During each iteration, the program checks whether the wake word has been detected. If the wake word is detected, it prints keyword detected.

The detection frequency is controlled using time.sleep(0.02) to prevent excessive CPU usage.

Pressing Ctrl+C triggers a KeyboardInterrupt, which gracefully exits the detection loop.

Upon exit, the program calls kws.exit() to stop the wake word detection process.

The fan is then restored to its original state (if applicable).

(4) Extended Functionality

Modifying the Wake-Up Response Text

In this section, you'll learn how to change the message that appears after a successful wake word detection.

① For example, if the wake word "**HELLO_HIWONDER**" is detected, and you'd like the program to print "**hello**" instead of the default message, follow the steps below. Navigate to the large_models directory and open the script with:

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter INSERT mode (you'll see -- INSERT -- at the bottom of the screen). Locate the line '**print('hello hiwonder')**', and modify it to 'print('hello')'

```
i
```

* **Speech Synthesis**

(1) What is Speech Synthesis?

Speech synthesis (SS) is a technology that converts written text into intelligible spoken audio. It enables computers to generate natural, human-like speech for communication or information delivery.

In this course, we will run a program that processes text using a large language model and generates corresponding audio.

(2) How It Works

The program first sends the text to the OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech) model. The model returns the generated audio data, which is saved as a file named tts_audio.wav for playback or storage.

(3) Preparation Before the Experiment

`/home/ubuntu/large_models/resources/audio/`

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/05/image5.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program is a speech synthesis system based on OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, capable of converting text into audio files. It supports input text and outputs audio in formats like PCM, WAV, FLAC, AAC, Opus, and MP3. By specifying the desired text, the program sends the request to the API and returns the synthesized audio, which can be played or saved locally.

The source code for this program is located at:  `/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_tts_demo.py`

① Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
from config import *
from speech import speech  
```

speech: This module encapsulates the TTS functionalities.

② Definition for TTS Class

{lineno-start=8}

```
tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?") # https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech

```

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/05/image12.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Once the program starts, the speaker will play the synthesized audio using the newly selected voice style.

* **Voice Interaction**

(1) What is Voice Interaction?

Voice Interaction (VI) refers to a method of communication between humans and computers or devices through spoken language. It integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, enabling devices to both understand user commands and respond naturally, creating true two-way voice communication. To achieve natural voice interaction, factors such as semantic understanding and sentiment analysis must also be considered, allowing the system to accurately interpret user intent and provide appropriate responses.

This approach can be used as the foundation for developing our own AI assistant features.

(2) How It Works

First, the wake word detection module listens for a specific wake-up word. Once detected, it initiates audio recording. After recording, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts the audio into text, which is then sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an appropriate response. The generated text is subsequently converted into speech through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module and played back to the user. This entire process enables seamless and natural interaction between the user and the voice assistant.

(3) Experiment Steps

① Power on the device and connect to it via MobaXterm (refer to Appendix "**5.1 Remote Connection Tools and Instructions**" for connection guidance).

② To check the microphone's port number, first disconnect the microphone and run the command. Then reconnect the microphone and run the command again to determine the port number (Note: do not connect any other USB devices during this process).

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

After disconnecting the microphone, no USB device should appear.

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/06/image2.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Upon reconnecting the microphone, a USB port (e.g., ttyCH341USB1) will be listed (make sure to note this device name). The device name may vary depending on the main controller.

③ Navigate to the program directory:

```
cd large_models/
```

④ Open the configuration file to enter your API Key. After editing, press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter to save and exit:

```
vim config.py
```

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/06/image4.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

⑤ Enter the port number you obtained and modify the corresponding microphone port settings for either WonderEcho Pro or the six-microphone setup. Uncomment the configuration for the port you intend to use and comment out the settings for any unused ports.

```
vim openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

If you are using the WonderEcho Pro, modify the corresponding section:

If you are using the 6-Microphone Array, modify the relevant section:

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/06/image5.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

⑥ Run the program:

```
python3 openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

⑦ To stop the program at any time, simply press Ctrl+C.

(4) Function Realization

After successful execution, the voice device will announce 'I'm ready.' Then, upon hearing the wake-up word 'HELLO_HIWONDER,' the device will respond with 'I'm here,' indicating that the assistant has been successfully awakened. You can now ask the AI assistant any questions:

For example: 'What are some fun places to visit in New York?'

<img  src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1.2/06/image7.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(5) Brief Program Analysis

The program integrates voice recognition, speech synthesis, and intelligent response functionalities to create a voice assistant. Interaction is initiated through the wake-up word (HELLO_HIWONDER). Users can converse with the assistant via voice commands, and the assistant will respond using text-to-speech technology. The overall structure is clear, with distinct modules that are easy to expand and maintain.

The source code for this program is located at: `/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_interaction_demo.py`

(1) Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from config import *
from speech import awake
from speech import speech
```

time: Used to control the interval between program executions.

speech: The core module, integrating wake-up word detection, speech activity detection, speech recognition, TTS, and LLM.

(2) Definition of Audio File Paths

{lineno-start=11}

```
wakeup_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/wakeup.wav'
start_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/start_audio.wav'
no_voice_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/no_voice.wav'
```

This section configures the audio file paths used by various functional modules, such as wake-up sounds, recording storage paths, and prompt sounds.

The text-to-speech (TTS) module is initialized to convert LLM responses into speech.

(3) Main Functional Logic

{lineno-start=33}

```
def main():
    kws.start()
    while True:
        try:
            if kws.wakeup(): # Wake word detected(检测到唤醒词)
                speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)  # Play wake-up sound(唤醒播放)
                asr_result = asr.asr() # Start voice recognition(开启录音识别)
                print('asr_result:', asr_result)
                if asr_result:
                    # Send the recognition result to the agent for a response(将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)
                    response = client.llm(asr_result, model='gpt-4o-mini')
                    print('llm response:', response)
                    tts.tts(response)
                else:
                    speech.play_audio(no_voice_audio_path)
            time.sleep(0.02)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            kws.exit() 
            try:
                os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
            except:
                pass
            break
        except BaseException as e:
            print(e)
```

Wake-up Detection: Continuously monitors for the wake-up word. Once detected, it stops the wake-up detection and plays the wake-up prompt sound.

Voice Processing: Records and recognizes the user's speech, uses the language model to generate a response, and then converts the response into speech for playback.

Error Handling: Catches exit signals and runtime errors to ensure the program exits safely and releases resources.

### 12.1.3 Vision Language Model Courses

* **Overview of Vision Language Model**

Vision Language Model (VLM) integrate visual recognition capabilities into traditional Language Model (LLM), enabling more powerful interactions between vision and language through multimodal inputs.

(1) Basic Concept

Vision Language Model (VLM) are a type of artificial intelligence model that leverages deep learning techniques to learn from and process large-scale visual data. These models often adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling them to extract rich visual features from images or video streams and perform various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. In theory, VLM possess powerful capabilities in feature extraction and pattern recognition, making them widely applicable in fields like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.

(2) Features

**Multimodal Input and Output**: VLM can process both images and text as input and generate various forms of output, including text, images, charts, and more.

**Powerful Visual-Semantic Understanding**: With extensive knowledge accumulated from large-scale visual datasets, VLMsexcel at tasks such as object detection, classification, and image captioning.

**Visual Question Answering (VQA):** VLM can engage in natural language conversations based on the content of input images, accurately answering vision-related questions.

**Image Generation:** Some advanced VLM are capable of generating simple image content based on given conditions.

**Deep Visual Understanding:** These models can recognize intricate details within images and explain underlying logical and causal relationships.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning:** VLM can leverage visual and linguistic information together, enabling reasoning across modalities, such as inferring from language to vision and vice versa.

**Unified Visual and Language Representation Space:** By applying attention mechanisms, VLM establish deep connections between visual and semantic information, achieving unified multimodal representations.

**Open Knowledge Integration:** VLM can integrate both structured and unstructured knowledge, enhancing their understanding of image content.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Vision Language Model is primarily based on deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. Through multiple layers of neurons, these models perform feature extraction and information processing, enabling them to automatically recognize and understand complex patterns within images.

In a VLM, the input image first passes through several convolutional layers, where local features such as edges, textures, and shapes are extracted. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by an activation function (e.g., ReLU) to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex representations. Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information, helping to optimize computational efficiency.

As the network deepens, it gradually transitions from extracting low-level features (like edges and corners) to higher-level features (such as objects and scenes). For classification tasks, the final feature vector is passed through fully connected layers to predict the probability of different target categories. For tasks like object detection and segmentation, the model outputs bounding boxes or masks to indicate the location and shape of objects within the image.

Transformer-based VLM divide images into small patches, treating them as sequential data, and apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within the image. This approach is particularly effective at modeling long-range dependencies, enabling VLM to excel at understanding complex visual scenes.

Training VLM typically requires large-scale labeled datasets. Through backpropagation, the model optimizes its parameters to minimize the loss between predictions and ground-truth labels. Pretraining on massive datasets allows the model to acquire general-purpose visual features, while fine-tuning on specific tasks further improves performance for specialized applications.

Thanks to this design, Visual Language Models are able to process and understand visual data effectively, and are widely used in applications like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, driving rapid progress in the field of computer vision.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Image Captioning

VLM can automatically generate textual descriptions based on input images. This capability is particularly valuable for social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and accessibility technologies, such as providing visual content descriptions for visually impaired users.

② Visual Question Answering

Users can ask questions related to an image, such as "**What is in this picture?**" or "**What color is the car?**" The model analyzes the image content and provides accurate, natural-language responses, making it highly applicable in fields such as education, customer support, and information services.

③ Image Retrieval

In image search engines, users can perform searches using text descriptions, and Vision Language Model (VLM) can understand the descriptions and return relevant images. This capability is especially important on e-commerce platforms, where it allows users to find desired products more intuitively.

④ Augmented Reality (AR)

Vision Language Model (VLM) can provide real-time visual feedback and language-based explanations in augmented reality applications. When users view real-world scenes through a device's camera, the system can overlay relevant information or guidance, enhancing the overall user experience.

⑤ Content Creation and Editing

In design and creative tools, Vision Language Model (VLM) can generate relevant text content or suggestions based on a user's visual input (such as sketches or images), helping users complete creative work more efficiently.

⑥ Social Media Interaction

On social media platforms, VLM can generate appropriate comments or tags based on user-uploaded images, enhancing engagement and interaction.

⑦ Medical Imaging Analysis

In the healthcare field, VLM can be used to analyze medical images (such as X-rays and CT scans) and generate diagnostic reports or recommendations, assisting doctors in making more accurate decisions.

### 12.1.4 Multimodal Model Basic Courses

* **Overview of Multimodal Model**

The emergence of Multimodal Model is built upon continuous advancements in the fields of Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM).

(1) Basic Concept

As LLM continue to improve in language understanding and reasoning capabilities, techniques such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting have become increasingly widespread. However, despite their strong performance on language tasks, LLM still exhibit notable limitations in perceiving and understanding visual information such as images. At the same time, VLM have made significant strides in visual tasks such as image segmentation and object detection, and can now be guided by language instructions to perform these tasks, though their reasoning abilities still require further enhancement.

(2) Features

The core strength of Multimodal Model lies in their ability to understand and manipulate visual content through language instructions. Through pretraining and fine-tuning, these models learn the associations between different modalities—such as how to generate descriptions from images or how to identify and classify objects in visual data. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms from deep learning, Multimodal Model can effectively capture relationships across modalities, allowing them to synthesize information from multiple sources during reasoning and decision-making processes.

**Multimodal Fusion Capability:** Multimodal Model can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This fusion ability enables the models to build connections across modalities, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of information. For instance, a model can generate natural language descriptions based on an image or identify specific objects within an image based on a text query.

**Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By integrating information from different modalities, Multimodal Model excel at contextual understanding. They can not only recognize content within a single modality but also combine clues from multiple sources to make more accurate judgments and decisions in complex tasks.

**Flexible Interaction Methods:** Users can interact with Multimodal Model through natural language instructions, making communication with the models more intuitive without requiring knowledge of complex programming or operations. For example, users can simply ask about details in an image, and the model can provide relevant answers.

**Scalability:** The architecture and training methods of Multimodal Model allow them to adapt to new modalities and tasks. As technology evolves, additional types of data—such as videos or sensor readings—can be incorporated, expanding their range of applications and capabilities.

**Strong Generative Capabilities:** Similar to large language models, Multimodal Model perform exceptionally well in generating both textual and visual content. They can produce natural language descriptions, summaries, and even create novel visual outputs, meeting a wide variety of application needs.

**Improved Reasoning Abilities:** Although challenges remain, Multimodal Model demonstrate significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to traditional single-modality models. By integrating multimodal information, they can reason effectively in more complex scenarios, supporting advanced tasks such as logical reasoning and sentiment analysis.

**Adaptability and Personalization:** Multimodal Model can be fine-tuned to meet user-specific needs and preferences, enabling highly personalized services. This adaptability offers great potential for applications in fields such as education, entertainment, and customer service.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Multimodal Model is built upon advanced deep learning and neural network technologies, with a core focus on fusing data from different modalities to understand and tackle complex tasks. At the foundation, Multimodal Model often adopt architectures similar to Transformers, which are highly effective at capturing relationships between different parts of input data. During training, these models are exposed to massive amounts of multimodal data—such as images, text, and audio—and leverage large-scale unsupervised learning for pretraining. Through this process, the models learn the commonalities and differences across modalities, enabling them to grasp the intrinsic connections between various types of information.

In practice, incoming text and visual data are first embedded into a shared representation space. Text inputs are transformed into vectors using word embedding techniques, while images are processed through methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features. These vectors are then fed into the model's encoder, where self-attention mechanisms analyze the relationships across modalities, identifying and focusing on the most relevant information.

After encoding, the model generates a multimodal contextual representation that blends both the semantic information of the text and the visual features of the image. When a user provides a natural language instruction, the MLLM parses the input and interprets the intent by leveraging the contextual representation. This process involves reasoning and generation capabilities, allowing the model to produce appropriate responses based on its learned knowledge, or to perform specific actions in visual tasks.

Finally, the Multimodal Model's decoder translates the processed information into outputs that users can easily understand—such as generating textual descriptions or executing targeted visual operations. Throughout this process, the emphasis is on the fusion and interaction of information across different modalities, enabling Multimodal Model to excel at handling complex combinations of natural language and visual content. This integrated working mechanism empowers Multimodal Model with powerful functionality and flexibility across a wide range of application scenarios.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Education

Multimodal Model can be used to create personalized learning experiences. By combining text and visual content, the model can provide students with rich learning materials—for example, explaining scientific concepts through a mix of images and text to enhance understanding. Additionally, in online courses, the model can dynamically adjust content based on the learner's performance, offering customized learning suggestions in real time.

② Healthcare

Multimodal Model can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. By analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or MRIs) alongside relevant medical literature, the model helps doctors access information more quickly and provides evidence-based recommendations. This application improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

③ Entertainment

Multimodal Model can be used for content generation, such as automatically creating stories, scripts, or in-game dialogues. By incorporating visual elements, the model can provide rich scene descriptions for game developers, enhancing immersion. Additionally, on social media platforms, Multimodal Model can analyze user-generated images and text to help recommend suitable content.

④ Advertising and Marketing

Multimodal Model can analyze consumer behavior and preferences to generate personalized advertising content. By combining text and images, ads can better capture the attention of target audiences and improve conversion rates.

Finally, Multimodal Model also play a role in scientific research. By processing large volumes of literature and image data, the model can help researchers identify trends, generate hypotheses, or summarize findings, accelerating scientific discovery.

### 12.3.2 Voice Control with Multimodal Large Model

* **Overview**

When the program starts running, WonderEcho Pro will announce **I'm ready** and begin monitoring the environment.

Say the wake word to activate WonderEcho Pro, and it will respond with **I'm here**. By default, the firmware uses the wake word **Hello Hiwonder**, please confirm the firmware version to use the correct wake word.

Then, you can control the robot using voice commands, for example, by saying **Hello, please move forward two steps**. The robot will use the OpenAI API to convert the voice into text and input it to the large model for processing. Once the model completes its reasoning, the result will be broadcast using the API and the corresponding action will be executed.

* **Preparation**

**1. Confirm WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

The factory default wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro is **Hello Hiwonder** in the English firmware. If you want to change the wake-up word to Xiaohuan Xiaohuan in Chinese, you can refer to the tutorial in the [12.2 Voice Module Introduction and Installation]() to flash the Chinese firmware.

If you have previously flashed a different firmware, such as the one using the wake word "**Xiaohuan Xiaohuan,**" you must use the corresponding wake word.

The examples in this course will assume the default factory wake word: "**Hello, Hiwonder**."

**2. Configuring the Large Model API-KEY**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.3.1 Obtain and Configure the Large Model API Key]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

**3. Network Configuration**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.**

The robot must be connected to the Internet during this feature, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. There are two methods available for configuring the network:

(1) To configure the network using the mobile app, you may refer to the tutorial of

[LAN Mode Connection (Optional)]() in the LanderPi User Manual.

(2) Connect to the robot via VNC and modify the network configuration files as described in

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The actions used in this feature is preset in the program library and the quantity is limited. The robot's movement is controlled by calling functions corresponding to the action strings designed by the large model. If the instruction involves unpreset actions, the program will not be able to execute, but the large model will recognize the instruction and give a response.**

* **Program Brief Analysis**

The program file is located at: [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examples/llm_control_move.launch.py](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examples/llm_control_move.launch.py)

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image29.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Reading Chassis Type**

Based on the selected chassis, corresponding prompt words are sent to the large model.

**Motion Control**

The `controller` activates the motion control node to control the motor, servo, buzzer, etc. of the expansion board.

**Large Model Control Node**

`start` activates the large model control node, which can achieve functions such as language detection, semantic understanding node, function execution, and response broadcast.

**(1) Program Brief Analysis**

The source code for this program is located at:  
[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examplesllm_control_move.py](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examplesllm_control_move.py)

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image30.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Language and Chassis Type Detection**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image31.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Import Libraries**

The program has imported the following modules and libraries to implement functions such as the creation of ROS2 nodes, message publishing, service invocation, thread handling, and voice playback.

**Initialization of ROS 2 node**

Call `rclpy.init()` to initialize the ROS2 environment and inherit the `Node` class to create a node instance.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image32.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Variable Initialization**

Define `action` (action list), `llm_result` (the result string returned by the large model), `running` (running flag), and `result` (the parsed result).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image33.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Publication and Subscriber Initialization**

① `tts_text_pub`: This publisher publishes the text message to the topic `tts_node/tts_text`. Send text to the speech synthesis module and let the robot give feedback to the user through voice

② `mecanum_pub`: This publisher publishes `Twist` messages to the `/controller/cmd_vel` topic. The `Twist` message contains the robot's linear velocity (x, y) and angular velocity (z), controlling the robot's movement.

③ `servo_state_pub`: This publisher publishes `SetPWMServoState` messages to the `ros_robot_controller/pwm_servo/set_state` topic to control the state of the servos.

④ `llm_result_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the `agent_process/result` topic. This topic contains instructions generated from LLMS (Large Language Models)

⑤ `play_audio_finish_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the topic `tts_node/play_finish`. This topic tells the program whether the voice playback is completed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image34.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Processing action process**

When instructions are received from the LLM, the script parses the JSON data to obtain the actions that need to be performed, such as moving forward, rotating, etc.

### 12.3.3 Autonomous Patrolling with Multimodal Large Model

* **Overview**

When the program starts running, WonderEcho Pro will announce **I'm ready** and begin monitoring the environment.

Say the wake word to activate WonderEcho Pro, and it will respond with **I'm here**. By default, the firmware uses the wake word **Hello Hiwonder**, please confirm the firmware version to use the correct wake word.

Then, the robot can be controlled via voice to follow a line, for example, by saying **Follow the black line**. The robot will use the OpenAI API to convert the speech into text and send it to the large model for processing. After the processing is complete, the OpenAI API is called again to broadcast the response generated from the model's reasoning, and the corresponding line-following program will be executed.

* **Preparation**

**1. Confirm WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

The factory default wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro is **Hello Hiwonder** in the English firmware. If you want to change the wake-up word to 'Xiaohuan Xiaohuan in Chinese, you can refer to the tutorial in the [12.2 Voice Module Introduction and Installation]() to flash the Chinese firmware.

12) To exit the feature, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. If the feature does not exit immediately, press **Ctrl+C** multiple times.

* **Project Outcome**

Once this feature is enabled, you can control the robot with voice commands. For example, saying **Go along the black line** will activate autonomous patrolling. In this feature, the robot will follow a black line as it moves. If the black line is not detected for more than 5 seconds, or if you wake the system again manually, the robot will exit the autonomous patrol task and return to standby mode.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The actions used in this feature is preset in the program library and the quantity is limited. The robot's movement is controlled by calling functions corresponding to the action strings designed by the large model.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image41.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Import Libraries**

The program has imported the following modules and libraries to implement functions such as the creation of ROS2 nodes, message publishing, service invocation, thread handling, and voice playback.

**Initialization of ROS 2 node**

Call `rclpy.init()` to initialize the ROS2 environment and inherit the Node class to create a node instance.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image32.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Variable Initialization**

Define `action` (action list), `llm_result` (the result string returned by the large model), `running` (running flag), and `result` (the parsed result).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image33.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Publication and Subscriber Initialization**

① `tts_text_pub`: This publisher publishes the text message to the topic `tts_node/tts_text`. Send text to the speech synthesis module and let the robot give feedback to the user through voice

② `mecanum_pub`: This publisher publishes `Twist` messages to the `/controller/cmd_vel` topic. The `Twist` message contains the robot's linear velocity (x, y) and angular velocity (z), controlling the robot's movement.

③ `llm_result_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the `agent_process/result` topic. This topic contains instructions generated from LLMS (Large Language Models)

④ `play_audio_finish_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the topic `tts_node/play_finish`. This topic tells the program whether the voice playback is completed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image42.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Check if it's Chinese**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image43.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Send the PROMPT**

The `PROMPT` variable defines the prompt message sent to the LLM. The LLM parse user input and generate output in JSON format containing actions and responses.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image44.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**init_process Method**

① It sets the `Prompt` for the LLM and stops the Mecanum-wheel robot's movement, plays Startup Audio, starts a new thread to run the `process` method, and creates a ROS 2 service `~/init_finish` as a signal to indicate that the node has finished initialization.

② It loops through the list of actions and calls the appropriate ROS 2 services based on the action type.

③ If an action is `line_following`, it extracts the required color information and calls the corresponding `line-following` service to begin tracking the line.

④ After all actions are executed, the `interrupt` flag is reset, the `llm_result` variable is cleared, and the voice wake-up functionality is re-enabled.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image45.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**main Function**

The main function runs.

**2. Large Model Line Following Logic Analysis**

**Large Model Interaction Logic Analysis**

The source code for this demo is located at [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app/line_following.py](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app/line_following.py)

This script receives the target line color information from the large model. The large model sends the target color name to this node by calling the `~/set_large_model_target_color` service.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image47.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**image_callback Callback Function**

① Target Loss Detection: When `deflection_angle` is `None`, it means the target line is not detected. In this case, the `follower.lost_target_count` counter is incremented. If `large_model_tracking` is `True` and the lost count exceeds a predefined threshold, the system considers the target lost. A timer is then triggered to stop the robot after a short delay.

② Target Reacquisition Detection: When `deflection_angle` is not `None`, the system detects the target line again. The `follower.lost_target_count` counter is reset, and the loss timer is canceled if active.

③ Motion Control The robot's movement is adjusted based on the output of the PID controller only when `deflection_angle` is not `None`, `is_running` is `True`, and no obstacles are detected.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image48.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Auto-Stop Mechanism**

① The `start_stop_timer` method starts a timer that waits 5 seconds before calling `stop_after_lose`.

② The `stop_after_lose` method stops the robot's movement and sets the `is_running` flag to `False` to end the line-following.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image49.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Voice Wake-Up Stop Handling**

When a voice wake-up signal is detected, the system may stop the robot—but only if `large_model_tracking` is set to `True`. This ensures that the voice wake-up signal is only responded to when the autonomous line following was initiated by the large language model.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image50.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examples/llm_color_track.py](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examples/llm_color_track.py)

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image55.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Import Libraries**

The program has imported the following modules and libraries to implement functions such as the creation of ROS2 nodes, message publishing, service invocation, thread handling, and voice playback.

**Initialization of ROS 2 node**

Call `rclpy.init()` to initialize the ROS2 environment and inherit the `Node` class to create a node instance.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image56.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Variable Initialization**

Define `action` (action list), `llm_result` (the result string returned by the large model), `running` (running flag), and `result` (the parsed result).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image57.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Publication and Subscriber Initialization**

(1) `tts_text_pub`: This publisher publishes the text message to the topic `tts_node/tts_text`. Send text to the speech synthesis module and let the robot give feedback to the user through voice

(2) `llm_result_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the `agent_process/result` topic. This topic contains instructions generated from LLMS (Large Language Models)

(3) `play_audio_finish_callback`: Subscribe to messages from the topic `tts_node/play_finish`. This topic tells the program whether the voice playback is completed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image58.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Check if it's Chinese**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image43.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Send the PROMPT**

The `PROMPT` variable defines the prompt message sent to the LLM. The LLM parse user input and generate output in JSON format containing actions and responses.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image59.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**init_process Method**

(1) It sets the `Prompt` for the LLM and stops the Mecanum-wheel robot's movement, plays Startup Audio, starts a new thread to run the `process` method, and creates a ROS 2 service `~/init_finish` as a signal to indicate that the node has finished initialization.

(2) It loops through the list of actions and calls the appropriate ROS 2 services based on the action type.

(3) If an action is `line_following`, it extracts the required color information and calls the corresponding `line-following` service to begin tracking the line.

(4) After all actions are executed, the `interrupt` flag is reset, the `llm_result` variable is cleared, and the voice wake-up functionality is re-enabled.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image60.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**main Function**

The main function executes.

**2. Large Model Line Following Logic Analysis**

**(1) Large Model Interaction Logic Analysis**

The source code for this demo is located at [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app/object_tracking.py.](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app/object_tracking.py.)

Function This script receives the target line color information from the large model. The large model sends the target color name to this node by calling the `~/set_large_model_target_color` service.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image62.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**image_callback Callback Function**

① If the `tracker` exists, it calls the tracker's `__call__` method to process the image and publishes motion control commands based on the results.

② If `is_running` is `True`, the motion control commands are published. Otherwise, the PID controller's output is cleared (reset).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image63.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Set Target Color Service Request**

Based on the coordinates provided in the request:

① If the coordinates are (-1, -1), reset the color selector and tracker.

② If the coordinates are valid, initialize the color selector and publish a `Twist` message.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_3/media/image64.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Handle Target Color Service Request**

This function is used to retrieve the current tracked target color. If a valid `tracker` object exists, it returns its `target_rgb` value.

### 12.4.2 Overview of Embodied Intelligence

* **Overview of Embodied Intelligence**

Embodied Intelligence represents a key branch of artificial intelligence that emphasizes learning and decision-making through the interaction between a physical entity and its environment. At its core lies the principle that intelligence emerges from the dynamic interplay between an agent's physical embodiment and its environment. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional AI, which often relies solely on static data. Embodied intelligence has found broad applications across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, service, education, and military.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image21.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Multimodal Information Fusion**

An important branch of embodied intelligence is multimodal information fusion, which refers to the effective integration of data from different modalities—such as text, images, and speech—to produce a more comprehensive and accurate representation of information. This process is especially critical in artificial intelligence, as real-world data is inherently multimodal. Relying on a single modality often fails to provide sufficient context or detail. Multimodal fusion aims to enhance model performance and robustness by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple data sources.

Several common approaches to multimodal information fusion include the following:

**Early Fusion:** Combines data from different modalities at an early stage of processing. This typically occurs at the input level, where raw data is aligned and transformed into a shared space to create a richer, more expressive representation. For example, image and speech data can be concatenated directly and fed into a neural network.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image22.jpeg" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Late Fusion:** Integrates data from multiple modalities at intermediate or output stages of the model. This approach allows each modality to be processed independently using specialized algorithms, making it easier to add or replace modalities in the future. For instance, results from image recognition and text analysis can be combined to support final decision-making.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image23.jpeg" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**Hybrid Fusion:** Leverages both early and late fusion techniques by performing integration at multiple stages. This method takes advantage of modality complementarity and can improve both performance and model robustness.

**Feature-Level Fusion:** Involves extracting features from each modality and mapping them into a unified feature vector, which is then passed to a classifier for decision-making. Fusion occurs during the feature extraction phase, enabling the model to learn correlations across modalities.

**Decision-Level Fusion:** Merges outputs from individual modality-specific decisions to produce the final outcome. This technique offers strong noise resistance and places fewer demands on sensor types or quality, though it may result in some loss of information.

**Deep Fusion:** Takes place during feature extraction, where multimodal data is blended in the feature space to generate fused features that can compensate for missing or weak signals from any single modality. These fused features are then used for classification or regression tasks during prediction.

Multimodal information fusion holds not only theoretical significance but also substantial practical value. It has been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and human-computer interaction, where it has significantly improved system performance and reliability.



### 12.4.3 Real-Time Detection in Embodied AI Applications

* **Overview**

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a large language model to analyze real-time scenes and implement a real-time detection feature. The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.

Say the wake word to activate WonderEcho Pro, and it will respond with **I'm here**. By default, the firmware uses the wake word **Hello Hiwonder**, please confirm the firmware version to use the correct wake word.

By activating this feature, you can freely give voice commands, and the robot will recognize the current scene, analyze it, and verbally report its analysis results.

* **Preparation**

**1. Confirm WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

The factory default wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro is Hello HiWonder in the English firmware. If you want to change the wake-up word to 'Xiaohuan Xiaohuan in Chinese, you can refer to the tutorial in the section [12.2 Voice Module Introduction and Installation]() to flash the Chinese firmware.

If you have previously flashed a different firmware, such as the one using the wake word "Xiaohuan Xiaohuan," you must use the corresponding wake word.

The examples in this course will assume the default factory wake word: **Hello, Hiwonder**.

**2. Configuring the Large Model API-KEY**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.3.1 Obtain and Configure the Large Model API Key]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

**3. Network Configuration**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.**

The robot must be connected to the Internet during this feature, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. There are two methods available for configuring the network:

- To configure the network using the mobile app, you may refer to the tutorial of

[LAN Mode Connection (Optional)]() in the LanderPi User Manual.

- Connect to the robot via VNC and modify the network configuration files as described in

[LAN Mode Connection]() in the section 4. Development Environment Setup and Configuration of the LanderPi User Manual.

* **Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Command input is case-sensitive and space-sensitive.**
>
> **The robot must be connected to the Internet, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet.**

1)  Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC. For detail informations, please refer to [4. Development Environment Setup and Configuration]() in the user manual.

2)  On the Raspberry Pi desktop, double-click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image29.png" style="width:30px" class="common_img"/> to open the terminal, and enter the ROS2 development environment.

   ```

5. When the terminal displays output shown in the figure and the voice device announces **I'm ready**, the voice device has completed initialization. Then, you can say the wake words: **Hello Hiwonder**.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image32.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

6. When the terminal displays the corresponding output shown in the figure and the device responds with **I'm here**, it indicates successful activation. The system will begin recording your voice command.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image33.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

7. When the terminal displays the next output as the reference image, it shows the recognized speech transcribed by the device.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image34.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

8. Upon successful recognition by the speech recognition service of cloud-based large speech model, the parsed command will be displayed under the `publish_asr_result` output in the terminal.

9. Upon receiving user input shown in the figure, the terminal will display output indicating that the cloud-based large language model has been successfully invoked. The model will interpret the command and generate a language response.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > **The response is automatically generated by the model. While the semantic content is accurate, the wording and structure may vary due to randomness in language generation.**

10. When the terminal shows the output shown in the figure indicating the end of one interaction cycle, the system is ready for the next round. To initiate another interaction, repeat step 4 by speaking the wake words again.

    <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image35.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

11. To exit the feature, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. If the feature does not exit immediately, press **Ctrl+C** multiple times.

    <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image36.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Project Outcome**

Once the feature is activated, you can phrase your own commands. For example, when you say **What do you see** to the robot, it will automatically analyze the scene within its field of view, think about what it sees, and describe the scene content in detail.

**process Method**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image76.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(1) **Check LLM Result** 

`if self.llm_result`: check whether `self.llm_result` contains content. If not empty, it indicates that a new result from the LLM needs to be processed. Otherwise, the system enters a short sleep to wait for new results.

(2) **Check for Action Commands**

`if 'action' in self.llm_result`: If the returned result contains the **action** field, it means that in addition to the response text, there are action commands to execute.

(3) **Extract and Parse JSON Data**: uses string search to locate the start and end of the JSON section, and parses it into a dictionary using `json.loads` to extract fields such as `response` and `action`.

(4) **Handle Text Response and Execute Actions:** If the parsed result contains `response`, assign the content to a message and publish it to the `tts_text_pub topic` to trigger TTS playback.

(5) **Move command:** If the action string contains `move`, first set `self.reach_goal` to `False`, call the corresponding move function using `eval` to execute dynamically, and then loop until `self.reach_goal` becomes `True`, which indicats that the robot has reached the goal. During this period, monitor `self.interrupt` to allow interruption.

(6) **Vision Detection:** If `vision` is present, execute the corresponding vision function, assign the returned result to `self.response_text`, and log the result.

(7) **Audio Display:** If `play_audio` is present, directly call the corresponding audio playback function.

(8) **Interrupt Check**: During each action execution, continuously monitor the `self.interrupt` flag. If an interrupt is triggered while waiting or executing an action, the current action is interrupted and the corresponding loop is exited in time.

(9) **Mark as Complete and Switch Mode**: Regardless of whether actions are included, after processing the current LLM result, set `self.action_finish` to True and clear `self.llm_result`. Later in the loop, when both `self.play_audio_finish` and `self.action_finish` are `True`, reset these two flags and send a mode-switch request via `set_mode_client`, entering the next state. Finally, when `self.running` becomes `False`, the loop exits and the ROS system is shut down.

**main Method**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image77.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(1) Create an instance of the `VLLMObjectTransport` node.

(2) A multithreaded executor is used to handle the node's tasks.

(3) Call `executor.spin()` to start processing ROS events.

(4) Upon shutdown, the node is properly destroyed using `node.destroy_node()`.

* **Modifying Navigation Locations**

To modify the navigation positions in the program, edit the file located at the following path:

[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/vllm_navigation.py](/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/vllm_navigation.py)

1)  Begin by launching the program and displaying the map in rviz following the section [Operation Steps]() above. Then, click on **2D Goal Pose** in the rviz interface to set the desired navigation target on the map.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image78.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

2. Return to the command terminal and check the published target position parameters, then fill them into the program accordingly.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image79.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image80.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Each list contains five values in the following order: x coordinate in meters, y coordinate in meters, roll angle with rotation around the x-axis in degrees, pitch angle with rotation around the y-axis in degrees, and yaw angle with rotation around the z-axis in degrees. Fill in the x and y coordinates according to the position reference in the diagram above. Next, convert the quaternion:  Quaternion(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=-0.5677173914973032, w=0.8232235197025761). After conversion to Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw), the result is approximately:  
roll ≈ 0°, pitch ≈ 0°, yaw ≈ -69.3°

### 12.4.5 Vision Tracking in Embodied AI Applications

* **Overview**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.**

Say the wake word to activate WonderEcho Pro, and it will respond with **I'm here**. By default, the firmware uses the wake word **Hello Hiwonder**, please confirm the firmware version to use the correct wake word.

Once activated, the robot can be controlled via voice commands. For example, saying **Track the purple ball** will prompt the terminal to display the recognized speech. The voice device will then broadcast the generated response and the robot will execute the corresponding action.

* **Preparation**

**1. Confirm WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

The factory default wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro is Hello HiWonder in the English firmware. If you want to change the wake-up word to 'Xiaohuan Xiaohuan in Chinese, you can refer to the tutorial in the section [12.2 Voice Module Introduction and Installation]() to flash the Chinese firmware.

If you have previously flashed a different firmware, such as the one using the wake word "Xiaohuan Xiaohuan," you must use the corresponding wake word.

The examples in this course will assume the default factory wake word: **Hello, Hiwonder**.

**2. Configuring the Large Model API-KEY**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.3.1 Obtain and Configure the Large Model API Key]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

### 12.4.6 Intelligent Transport in Embodied AI Applications

* **Overview**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.**

Say the wake word to activate WonderEcho Pro, and it will respond with **I'm here**. By default, the firmware uses the wake word **Hello Hiwonder**, please confirm the firmware version to use the correct wake word.

Once activated, the robot can be controlled by voice commands. For example, you can say: **Put the red block into the blue box**. Upon receiving a command, the terminal displays the recognized speech content. The voice device then verbally responds with a generated answer and the robot simultaneously executes the corresponding action.

* **Preparation**

**1. Confirm WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

The factory default wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro is Hello HiWonder in the English firmware. If you want to change the wake-up word to 'Xiaohuan Xiaohuan in Chinese, you can refer to the tutorial in the section [12.2 Voice Module Introduction and Installation]() to flash the Chinese firmware.

If you have previously flashed a different firmware, such as the one using the wake word "Xiaohuan Xiaohuan," you must use the corresponding wake word.

The examples in this course will assume the default factory wake word: **Hello, Hiwonder**.

**2. Configuring the Large Model API-KEY**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.3.1 Obtain and Configure the Large Model API Key]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

**3. Network Configuration**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The large model used in this lesson is an online model, so network access is required before getting started. Please prepare an Ethernet cable to connect the robot to the network, or switch the robot to LAN mode.**

The robot must be connected to the Internet during this feature, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. There are two methods available for configuring the network:

(1) To configure the network using the mobile app, you may refer to the tutorial of

[LAN Mode Connection (Optional)]() in the LanderPi User Manual.

(2) Connect to the robot via VNC and modify the network configuration files as described in

[LAN Mode Connection]() in the section 4. Development Environment Setup and Configuration of the LanderPi User Manual.

**4. Grasp and Placement Calibration**

Before starting the intelligent handling process, you need to adjust the grasping behavior to ensure accurate performance. If the robotic arm fails to pick up the colored blocks during the demo or operation, you can follow the steps below to perform grasp calibration. This allows you to adjust the pickup area using program commands.

(1) Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC. For detail informations, please refer to [4. Development Environment Setup and Configuration]() in the user manual.

(2) On the Raspberry Pi desktop, double-click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image29.png" style="width:30px" class="common_img"/> to open the terminal, and enter the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Enter the command to disable the app auto-start service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) To begin grasp calibration, enter the following command:

```
ros2 launch large_models_examples automatic_pick.launch.py debug:=pick
```

(5) Wait until the program finishes loading and you hear the voice prompt **I'm ready**.

(6) The robotic arm will perform a calibration grasping action and place the object at the gripper's pickup location. Once the robotic arm returns to its original posture, use the **mouse** to left-click and **drag a bounding box** around the target object on the screen. Once the object is correctly identified, the system will automatically calibrate the pickup position for that specific target.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image107.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(7) The calibration process for placing objects is the same as for grasping. To begin placement calibration, run the following command:

```
ros2 launch large_models_examples automatic_pick.launch.py debug:=place
```

**5. Navigation Map Construction**

Before enabling this feature, a map must be created in advance. Please refer to [6.1 Mapping Instruction]() in 6. Mapping & Navigation Course for detailed instructions on how to build the map.

* **Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> * **Command input is case-sensitive and space-sensitive.**
>
> * **The robot must be connected to the Internet, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet.**

1. Double click on the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image109.png" style="width:30px" class="common_img"/> to open a terminal.

2. Enter the command to disable the app auto-start service.

   ```
   ~/.stop_ros.sh
   ```

3. Enter the following command and press Enter to launch the intelligent transport feature.

   ```
   ros2 launch large_models_examples vllm_navigation_transport.launch.py map:=map_01
   ```

4. Use the virtual machine to open the navigation RViz tool. For details, refer to the section [6.1 Navigation Instruction]() in the file 6. Mapping & Navigation Course.

5. After opening the map in RViz, click the **2D Pose Estimate** icon to set the robot's initial position.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image111.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

6. When the terminal displays output shown in the figure and the voice device announces **I'm ready**, the device has completed initialization and yolov8 model will be initialized at the same time. Then, you can say the wake words **Hello Hiwonder**.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image112.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image113.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

7. When the terminal displays the corresponding output shown in the figure and the device responds with **I'm here**, it indicates successful activation. The system will begin recording your voice command.

   Speak a command such as **Put the red square in the blue box.** The voice device will capture the speech, and the large language model will process the command.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image114.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

8. Upon successful recognition by the speech recognition service of cloud-based large speech model, the parsed command will be displayed under the `publish_asr_result` output in the terminal.

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image114.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

9. Upon receiving user input shown in the figure, the terminal will display output indicating that the cloud-based large language model has been successfully invoked. The model will interpret the command, generate a language response, and execute a corresponding action based on the meaning of the command.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > **The response is automatically generated by the model. While the semantic content is accurate, the wording and structure may vary due to randomness in language generation.**

   <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image115.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

10. The robot will first move to the red block and complete the task of picking it up.

    <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image116.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

11. Then it will go to the blue box and place the block inside.

    <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image117.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

12. When the terminal shows the output shown in the figure indicating the end of one interaction cycle, the system is ready for the next round. To initiate another interaction, repeat step 4 by speaking the wake words again.

    <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image118.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

13. To exit the feature, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. If the feature does not exit immediately, press **Ctrl+C** multiple times.

* **Project Outcome**

Once the program is activated, you can phrase your own commands. For example, saying **Put the red block into the blue box** will make the robot first move to the red block, pick it up, then navigate to the blue box waypoint, and place the block inside.

* **Modifying Navigation Locations**

To modify the navigation positions in the program, edit the file located at the following path:

[~/ros2_ws/src/large_models_examples/large_models_examples/navigation_transport/vllm_navigation_transport.py]()

1)  Begin by launching the program and displaying the map in rviz following step 4 above. Then, click on **2D Goal Pose** in the rviz interface to set the desired navigation target on the map.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image119.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

2)  Return to the command terminal and check the published target position parameters.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image79.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Locate the corresponding section of the code shown below, and fill in your target location parameters after the appropriate location name.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image120.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

In the program, each location is defined as a target navigation point relative to the map's origin, which corresponds to the robot's starting position during the mapping process. Each navigation point includes five parameters:

x: position on the x-axis (meters)

y: position on the y-axis (meters)

roll: rotation around the x-axis (degrees)

pitch: rotation around the y-axis (degrees)

yaw: rotation around the z-axis (degrees)

For example, to define the position of **green square**, the parameters can be set to \[0.0, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 90.0\], indicating that the robot will navigate to a location offset from the map origin by those values.

For example, given the quaternion: Quaternion(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=-0.5677173914973032, w=0.8232235197025761). After conversion to Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw), the result is approximately: roll ≈ 0°, pitch ≈ 0°, yaw ≈ -69.3°
