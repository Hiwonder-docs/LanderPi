## 8.1 Machine Learning Basics

### 8.1.1 Introduction to Machine Learning

* **Overview**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a new technological science focused on the theories, methods, technologies, and applications used to simulate, extend, and augment human intelligence.

AI encompasses various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning. Among them, machine learning is a subfield of AI, and deep learning is a specific type of machine learning.

Since its inception, AI has seen rapid development in both theory and technology, with expanding application areas, gradually evolving into an independent discipline.

* **What Machine Learning is**

Machine Learning is the core of AI and the fundamental approach to enabling machine intelligence. It is an interdisciplinary field involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithmic complexity, and more.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1/media/image1.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

The essence of machine learning lies in enabling computers to simulate or implement human learning behaviors in order to acquire new knowledge or skills, and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve performance. From a practical perspective, machine learning involves training models using data and making predictions with those models.

Take AlphaGo as an example—it was the first AI program to defeat a professional human Go player and later a world champion. AlphaGo operates based on deep learning, which involves learning the underlying patterns and hierarchical representations from sample data to gain insights.

* **Types of Machine Learning**

Machine learning is generally classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning, with the key distinction being whether the dataset's categories or patterns are known.

**1. Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning provides a dataset along with correct labels or answers. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data. This is the most common type of machine learning.

Labeled Data: Supervised learning uses training data that includes both input features and corresponding labels or outputs. Features describe the attributes of the data, while labels represent the target variable the model is expected to predict or classify. For instance, in image recognition, a large number of images of dogs can be labeled as "dog." The machine learns to recognize dogs in new images through this data.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1/media/image2.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate model to represent the relationship in data is crucial. Common models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural networks. The choice depends on the data characteristics and the specific problem.

Feature Engineering: This involves preprocessing and transforming raw data to extract meaningful features. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization or standardization, feature selection, and feature transformation. Good feature engineering enhances model performance and generalization.

Training and Optimization: Using labeled training data, the model is trained to fit the underlying relationships. This typically involves defining a loss function, selecting an appropriate optimization algorithm, and iteratively adjusting model parameters to minimize the loss. Common optimization methods include gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated to assess its performance on new data. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Evaluating the model ensures it is suitable for real-world applications.

In summary, supervised learning involves using labeled training data to build a model that can classify or predict unseen data. Key steps include model selection, feature engineering, model training and optimization, and performance evaluation. Together, these steps form the foundation of supervised learning.

**2. Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning involves providing the algorithm with data without labels or known answers. All data is treated equally, and the machine is expected to uncover hidden structures or patterns.

For example, in image classification, if you provide a set of images containing cats and dogs without any labels. The algorithm will analyze the data and automatically group the images into two categories—cat images and dog images—based on similarities.

### 8.1.2 Introduction to Machine Learning Libraries

* **Common Machine Learning Frameworks**

There are many machine learning frameworks available. The most commonly used include PyTorch, TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, and MXNet.

**1. PyTorch**

Torch is an open-source machine learning framework under the BSD License, widely used for its powerful multi-dimensional array operations. PyTorch is a machine learning library based on Torch but offers greater flexibility, supports dynamic computation graphs, and provides a Python interface.

Unlike TensorFlow's static computation graphs, PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, which can be modified in real-time according to the needs of the computation. PyTorch allows developers to accelerate tensor operations using GPUs, build dynamic graphs, and perform automatic differentiation.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1.2/media/image1.png" style="width:300px" class="common_img"/>

**2. Tensorflow**

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework designed to simplify the process of building, training, evaluating, and saving neural networks. It enables the implementation of machine learning and deep learning concepts in the simplest way. With its foundation in computational algebra and optimization techniques,

TensorFlow allows for efficient mathematical computations. It can run on a wide range of hardware—from supercomputers to embedded systems—making it highly versatile. TensorFlow supports CPU, GPU, or both simultaneously. Compared to other frameworks, TensorFlow is best suited for industrial deployment, making it highly appropriate for use in production environments.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1.2/media/image2.png" style="width:300px" class="common_img"/>

**3. PaddlePaddle**

PaddlePaddle, developed by Baidu, is China's first open-source, industrial-grade deep learning platform. It integrates a deep learning training and inference framework, a library of foundational models, end-to-end development tools, and a rich suite of supporting components. Built on years of Baidu's R&D and real-world applications in deep learning, PaddlePaddle is powerful and versatile.

In recent years, deep learning has achieved outstanding performance across many fields such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, online advertising, medical diagnostics, and finance.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1.2/media/image3.png" style="width:300px" class="common_img"/>

**4. MXNet**

MXNet is another high-performance deep learning framework that supports multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, Scala, and R. It offers data flow graphs similar to those in Theano and TensorFlow and supports multi-GPU configuration. It also includes high-level components for model building, comparable to those in Lasagne and Blocks, and can run on nearly any hardware platform—including mobile devices.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_1.2/media/image4.png" style="width:300px" class="common_img"/>

MXNet is designed to maximize efficiency and flexibility. As an accelerated library, it provides powerful tools for developers to take full advantage of GPUs and cloud computing. MXNet supports distributed deployment via a parameter server and can scale almost linearly across multiple CPUs and GPUs.

## **8.2 Machine Learning Application**

### 8.2.1 Yolov8 Model

* **Introduction to the YOLO Series of Models**

**1. YOLO Series**

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a One-stage, deep learning-based regression approach to object detection.

Before the advent of YOLOv1, the R-CNN family of algorithms dominated the object detection field. Although the R-CNN series achieved high detection accuracy, its Two-stage architecture limited its speed, making it unsuitable for real-time applications.

To address this issue, the YOLO series was developed. The core idea behind YOLO is to redefine object detection as a regression problem. It processes the entire image as input to the network and directly outputs Bounding Box coordinates along with their corresponding class labels. Compared to traditional object detection methods, YOLO offers faster detection speed and higher average precision.

**2. Yolov8**

Yolov8 builds upon previous versions of the YOLO model, delivering significant improvements in both detection speed and accuracy.

A typical object detection algorithm can be divided into four modules: the input module, the backbone network, the neck network, and the head output module. Analyzing Yolov8 according to these modules reveals the following enhancements:

(1) Input Module: During model training, Yolov8 uses Mosaic data augmentation to improve training speed and accuracy. It also introduces adaptive anchor box calculation and adaptive image scaling.

(2) Backbone Network: Yolov8 incorporates the Focus and CSP structures.

(3) Neck Network: Similar to YOLOv4, Yolov8 adopts the FPN+PAN architecture in this part, though there are differences in implementation details.

(4) Head Output Module: While the anchor box mechanism in Yolov8 remains consistent with YOLOv4, improvements include the use of the GIOU_Loss loss function and DIOU_NMS for filtering predicted bounding boxes.

* **Yolov8 Model Structure**

**1. Components**

(1) Convolutional Layer: Feature Extraction

Convolution is the process where an entity at multiple past time points does or is subjected to the same action, influencing its current state. Convolution can be divided into convolution and multiplication.

Convolution can be understood as flipping the data, and multiplication as the accumulation of the influence that past data has on the current data. The data flipping is done to establish relationships between data points, facilitating the calculation of accumulated influence with a proper reference.

In Yolov8, the data to be processed is images, which are two-dimensional in computer vision. Accordingly, the convolution is two-dimensional convolution. The purpose of 2D convolution is to extract features from images. To perform 2D convolution, it is necessary to understand the convolution kernel.

The convolution kernel is the unit region over which convolution calculation is performed each time. The unit is pixels, and the convolution sums the pixel values within the region. Typically, convolution is done by sliding the kernel across the image, and the kernel size is manually set.

When performing convolution, depending on the desired effect, the image borders may be padded with zeros or extended by a certain number of pixels, then the convolution results are placed back into the corresponding positions in the image. For example, a 6×6 image is first expanded to 7×7, then convolved with the kernel, and finally the results are filled back into a blank 6×6 image.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image5.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image6.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(2) Pooling Layer: Feature Amplification

The pooling layer, also called downsampling layer, is usually used together with convolution layers. After convolution, pooling performs further sampling on the extracted features. Pooling includes various types such as global pooling, average pooling, max pooling, etc., each producing different effects.

To make it easier to understand, max pooling is used here as an example. Before understanding max pooling, it is important to know about the filter, which is like the convolution kernel—a manually set region that slides over the image and selects pixels within the area.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image7.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Max pooling keeps the most prominent features and discards others. For example, starting with a 6×6 image, applying a 2×2 filter for max pooling produces a new image with reduced size.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image8.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(3) Upsampling Layer: Restoring Image Size

Upsampling can be understood as "reverse pooling." After pooling, the image size shrinks, and upsampling restores the image back to its original size. However, only the size is restored, the pooled features are also modified accordingly.

For example, starting with a 6×6 image, applying a 3×3 filter for upsampling produces a new image.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image9.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(4) Batch Normalization Layer: Data Regularization

Batch normalization means rearranging the data neatly, which reduces the computational difficulty of the model and helps map data better into the activation functions.

Batch normalization reduces the loss rate of features during each calculation, retaining more features for the next computation. After multiple computations, the model's sensitivity to the data increases.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image10.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(5) ReLU Layer: Activation Function

Activation functions are added during model construction to introduce non-linearity. Without activation functions, each layer is essentially a matrix multiplication. Every layer's output is a linear function of the previous layer's input, so no matter how many layers the neural network has, the output is just a linear combination of the input. This prevents the model from adapting to actual situations.

There are many activation functions, commonly ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, etc. Here, ReLU is used as an example. ReLU is a piecewise function that replaces all values less than 0 with 0 and keeps positive values unchanged.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image11.GIF" style="width:350px" class="common_img"/>

(6) ADD Layer: Tensor Addition

Features can be significant or insignificant. The ADD layer adds feature tensors together to enhance the significant features.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image12.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(7) Concat Layer: Tensor Concatenation

The Concat layer concatenates feature tensors to combine features extracted by different methods, thereby preserving more features.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image13.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**2. Composite Elements**

When building a model, using only the basic layers mentioned earlier can lead to overly lengthy, disorganized code with unclear hierarchy. To improve modeling efficiency, these basic elements are often grouped into modular units for reuse.

(1) Convolutional Block

A convolutional block consists of a convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, and an activation function. The process follows this order: convolution → batch normalization → activation.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image14.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(2) Strided Sampling and Concatenation Unit（Focus）

The input image is first divided into multiple large regions. Then, small image patches located at the same relative position within each large region are concatenated together to form a new image. This effectively splits the input image into several smaller images. Finally, an initial sampling is performed on the images using a convolutional block.

As shown in the figure below, for a 6×6 image, if each large region is defined as 2×2, the image can be divided into 9 large regions, and each contains 4 small patches.

By taking the small patches at position 1 from each large region and concatenating them, a 3×3 image can be formed. The patches at other positions are concatenated in the same way.  
Ultimately, the original 6×6 image is decomposed into four 3×3 images.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image15.png" class="common_img"/>

(3) Residual Block

The residual block enables the model to learn subtle variations in the image. Its structure is relatively simple and involves merging data from two paths.

In the first path, two convolutional blocks are used to extract features from the image. In the second path, the original image is passed through directly without convolution. Finally, the outputs from both paths are added together to enhance learning.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image16.png" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image17.png" class="common_img"/>

(4) Composite Convolutional Block

In Yolov8, a key feature of the composite convolutional block is its customizable design, allowing convolutional blocks to be configured as needed. This structure also uses two paths whose outputs are merged.

The first path contains a single convolutional layer for feature extraction, while the second path includes 2𝑥+1 convolutional blocks followed by an additional convolutional layer. After sampling and concatenation, batch normalization is applied to standardize the data, followed by an activation function. Finally, a convolutional block is used to process the combined features.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image18.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(5) Composite Residual Convolutional Block

The composite residual convolutional block modifies the composite convolutional block by replacing the 2𝑥 convolutional blocks with 𝑥 residual blocks. In Yolov8, this block is also customizable, allowing residual blocks to be tailored according to specific requirements.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image20.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

(6) Composite Pooling Block

The output from a convolutional block is simultaneously passed through three separate max pooling layers, while an additional unprocessed copy is preserved. The resulting four feature maps are then concatenated and passed through a convolutional block. By processing data with the composite pooling block, the original features can be significantly enhanced and emphasized.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image21.png" class="common_img"/>

**3. Structure**

Yolov8 is composed of three main parts, each responsible for producing output at different spatial resolutions. These outputs are processed differently according to their respective sizes. The structure of Yolov8's output is shown as the diagram below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image22.png" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image23.png" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image25.png" class="common_img"/>

### 8.2.2 Yolov8 Workflow

This section explains the model's processing flow using the concepts of prior boxes, predicted boxes, and anchor boxes.

* **Prior Box**

When an image is fed into the model, predefined regions of interest must be specified. These regions are marked using prior boxes, which serve as initial bounding box templates indicating potential object locations in the image.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image26.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Predicted Box**

Predicted boxes are generated by the model as output and do not require manual input. When the first batch of training data is fed into the model, the predicted boxes are automatically created. The center points of predicted boxes tend to be located in areas where similar objects frequently appear.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image27.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Anchor Box**

Since predicted boxes may have deviations in size and location, anchor boxes are introduced to correct these predictions.

Anchor boxes are positioned based on the predicted boxes. By influencing the generation of subsequent predicted boxes, anchor boxes are placed around their relative centers to guide future predictions.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image28.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Project Process**

Once the bounding box annotations are complete, prior boxes appear on the image. When the image data is input into the model, predicted boxes are generated based on the locations of the prior boxes. Subsequently, anchor boxes are generated to adjust the predicted results. The weights from this round of training are then updated in the model.

With each new training iteration, the predicted boxes are influenced by the anchor boxes from the previous round. This process is repeated until the predicted boxes gradually align with the prior boxes in both size and location.

### 8.2.3 Image Collection and Annotation

Training a YOLOv8 model requires a large dataset, so you must first collect and annotate images to prepare for model training.

In this example, the demonstration uses traffic signs as target objects.

* **Image Collection**

1. Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC.

2. Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image30.png" style="width:30px"/> in the system desktop to open a command-line window.

3. Stop the app auto-start service by entering the following command:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

4. Start the depth camera service with command.

```
ros2 launch peripherals depth_camera.launch.py
```

5. Open a new command-line terminal and enter the command to create a directory for storing your dataset.

```
mkdir -p ~/my_data
```

6. Then, launch the tool by entering the following command.

```
cd ~/software/collect_picture && python3 main.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image35.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

The **save number** in the top-left corner of the tool interface shows the ID of the saved image. The **existing** shows how many images have already been saved.

7)  Click Choose to change the save path to the **my_data** folder created before.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image36.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

8. After selecting the target directory, click **Choose**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image37.png" style="width:450px" class="common_img"/>

9. Place the target object within the camera view and click the **Save (space)** button or press the spacebar to save the current camera frame.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image38.png" style="width:450px" class="common_img"/>

After clicking on **Save (space)** or the spacebar, a folder named **JPEGImages** will be automatically created under the path `/home/ubuntu/my_data` to store the images.

> [!NOTE]

### 8.2.4 Data Format Conversion

* **Preparation**

Before starting this section, make sure you have completed image collection and annotation. For detailed steps, refer to the section [8.2.3 Image Collection and Annotation](#anchor_8_2_3).

Before training images using the YOLOv8 model, you need to define class labels and convert the annotation data into the appropriate format.

* **Data Format Conversion**

Before starting this section, make sure you have completed image collection and annotation.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **When entering commands, be sure to use correct case and spacing. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.**

1)  Open a new terminal and enter the following command to open the file: 

> [!NOTE]
>
> **You can create a file if the file cannot be found.**

```
vim ~/my_data/classes.names
```

2)  Press the key **i**, and enter the annotated class name **left** in the text file. If you have multiple class names, list each one on a new line.

3)  After editing, press **Esc**, type the command `:wq`, and press **Enter** to save and exit.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The class names here must match the labels used in the labelImg annotation tool exactly.**

4. Next, return to the terminal and run the following command to convert the annotation format:

```
python3 ~/software/xml2yolo.py --data ~/my_data --yaml ~/my_data/data.yaml
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Make sure the paths to ~/software/xml2yolo.py and my_data match your actual file structure!**

This command uses three main parameters:

1. xml2yolo.py: A script that converts annotations from XML format to the YOLOv8 format. Make sure the path is correct.

2. my_data: The directory containing your annotated dataset.

3. data.yaml: A YAML file that specifies how the dataset is split and configured for training. It will be saved inside the **my_data** folder.

The following image shows a generated example of **data.yaml**:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image60.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

The items listed after `names` represent the types of labels. The `nc` field specifies the total number of label categories. `train` refers to the training set—a commonly used term in deep learning that indicates the data used for model training. The parameter following it is the path to the training images. Similarly, `val` refers to the validation set, which is used to verify the model's performance during the training process, and the path that follows indicates where the validation data is located. These file paths need to be set based on the actual location of your data. For example, if you plan to speed up the training process later by moving the dataset from the robot to a local PC or a cloud server, you'll need to update the `train` and `val` paths accordingly to reflect their new locations.

Finally, an XML file will be generated under the **~/my_data** folder to record the path location of the currently split dataset. Similarly, you can change the save path by modifying the last parameter in step 4 to `~/my_data/data.yaml`. Please remember the path of this file, as it will be used later for model training.

### 8.2.5 Model Training

> [!NOTE]

> **When entering commands, be sure to use correct case and spacing. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.**

* **Preparation**

After converting the dataset format, you can proceed to the model training phase. Before starting, make sure the dataset with the correct format is ready. For details, refer to the section **[8.2.4 Data Format Conversion](#anchor_8_2_4)**.

* **Model Training**

1. Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC.

2. Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_2/media/image30.png" style="width:30px"/> in the system desktop to open a command-line window.

3. Enter the following command and press Enter to go to the specific directory.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/third_party_ros2/yolo/yolov8
```

4. Enter the command to start training the model.

```
python3 train.py --img 640 --batch 64 --epochs 300 --data ~/my_data/data.yaml --weights yolov8n.pt
```

In the command, the parameters stands for:

### 8.2.6 Traffic Sign Model Training

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The product names and reference paths mentioned in this document may vary. Please refer to the actual setup for accurate information.** 

When dealing with large datasets, it is not recommended to train models directly on the robot's onboard motherboard due to I/O speed and memory limitations. Instead, it is advised to use a PC with a dedicated GPU, which follows the same training steps, only requiring proper environment configuration.

If the traffic sign recognition in the autonomous driving scenario is not performing well, you can train a custom model by following the instructions in this section.

In the following instructions, screenshots may show different robot hostnames as different robots have similar environment setups. Simply follow the command steps in the document as described — it does not affect the execution.

* **Preparation**

### 8.3.4 Face Detection

In this program, MediaPipe's face detection model is utilized to detect human face within the camera image.

MediaPipe Face Detection is a high-speed face detection solution that provides six key landmarks and supports multiple faces. It is based on BlazeFace, a lightweight and efficient face detector optimized for mobile GPU inference.

* **Program Introduction**

First, import the MediaPipe face detection model and subscribe to the topic messages to obtain the real-time camera feed.

Next, use OpenCV to process the image, including flipping and converting the color space.

Next, the system compares the detection confidence against the model's minimum threshold to determine if face detection is successful. Once a face is detected, the system will analyze the set of facial features. Each face is represented as a detection message that contains a bounding box and six key landmarks, including right eye, left eye, nose tip, mouth center, right ear region, and left ear region.

Finally, the face will be outlined with a bounding box, and the six key landmarks will be marked on the image.

* **Operation Steps**

### 8.3.5 3D Face Detection

In this program, MediaPipe Face Mesh is utilized to detect human face within the camera image.

MediaPipe Face Mesh is a powerful model capable of estimating 468 3D facial features, even when deployed on a mobile device. It uses machine learning (ML) to infer 3D facial structure. This model leverages a lightweight architecture and GPU acceleration to deliver critical real-time performance.

Additionally, the solution is bundled with a face transformation module that bridges the gap between facial landmark estimation and practical real-time augmented reality (AR) applications. It establishes a metric 3D space and uses the screen positions of facial landmarks to estimate face transformations within that space. The face transformation data consists of common 3D primitives, including a facial pose transformation matrix and a triangulated face mesh.

* **Program Introduction**

First, it's important to understand that the machine learning pipeline used here, which can be thought of as a linear process, consists of two real-time deep neural network models working in tandem: One is a detector that processes the full image to locate faces. The other is a face landmark model that operates on those locations and uses regression to predict an approximate 3D surface.

For the 3D face landmarks, transfer learning was applied, and a multi-task network was trained. This network simultaneously predicts 3D landmark coordinates on synthetic rendered data and 2D semantic contours on annotated real-world data. As a result, the network is informed by both synthetic and real-world data, allowing for accurate 3D landmark prediction.

The 3D landmark model takes cropped video frames as input, without requiring additional depth input. It outputs the positions of 3D points along with a probability score indicating whether a face is present and properly aligned in the input.

After importing the face mesh model, you can subscribe to the topic messages to obtain the real-time camera feed.

The image is processed through operations such as flipping and color space conversion. Then, by comparing the face detection confidence to a predefined threshold, it determines whether a face has been successfully detected.

Finally, a 3D mesh is rendered over the detected face in the video feed.

* **Operation Steps**

1. Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC. For detail informations, please refer to [1.4 Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/1_LanderPi_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration).

### 8.3.6 Hand Keypoint Detection

In this lesson, MediaPipe's hand detection model is used to display hand keypoints and the connecting lines between them on the returned image.

MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking model. It uses machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from a single frame.

* **Program Introduction**

First, it's important to understand that MediaPipe's palm detection model utilizes a machine learning pipeline composed of multiple models, which is a linear model, similar to an assembly line. The model processes the entire image and returns an oriented hand bounding box. The hand landmark model then operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints.

After importing the hand detection model, the system subscribes to topic messages to acquire real-time camera images.

The images are then processed with flipping and color space conversion, which greatly reduces the need for data augmentation for the hand landmark model.

In addition, the pipeline can generate crops based on the hand landmarks recognized in the previous frame. The palm detection model is only invoked to re-locate the hand when the landmark model can no longer detect its presence.

Next, the system compares the detection confidence against the model's minimum threshold to determine if hand detection is successful.

Finally, it detects and draws the hand keypoints on the output image.

* **Operation Steps**

1. Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC.

### 8.3.7 Body Keypoint Detection

In this lesson, MediaPipe's pose detection model is used to detect body landmarks and display them on the video feed.

MediaPipe Pose is a high-fidelity body pose tracking model. Powered by BlazePose, it infers 33 3D landmarks across the full body from RGB input. This research also supports the ML Kit Pose Detection API.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image39.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

* **Program Introduction**

First, import the pose detection model.

Then, the program applys image preprocessing such as flipping and converting the color space. By comparing against a minimum detection confidence threshold, it determines whether the human body is successfully detected.

Next, it uses a minimum tracking confidence threshold to decide whether the detected pose can be reliably tracked. If not, the model will automatically re-invoke detection on the next input image.

The pipeline first identifies the region of interest (ROI) containing the person's pose in the frame using a detector. The tracker then uses the cropped ROI image as input to predict pose landmarks and segmentation masks within that area. For video applications, the detector is only invoked when necessary—such as for the first frame or when the tracker fails to identify a pose from the previous frame. For all other frames, the ROI is derived from the previously tracked landmarks.

After importing the MediaPipe pose detection model, you can subscribe to the topic messages to obtain the real-time video stream from the camera.

Finally, it identifies and draws the body landmarks on the image.

* **Operation Steps**

### 8.3.8 Fingertip Trajectory Recognition

The robot uses MediaPipe's hand detection model to recognize palm joints. Once a specific hand gesture is detected, the robot locks onto the fingertip in the image and begins tracking it, drawing the movement trajectory of the fingertip.

* **Program Introduction**

First, the MediaPipe hand detection model is called to process the camera feed.

Next, the image is flipped and processed to detect hand information within the frame. Based on the connections between hand landmarks, the finger angles are calculated to identify specific gestures.

Finally, once the designated gesture is recognized, the robot starts tracking and locking onto the fingertip, while displaying its movement trajectory in the video feed.

* **Program Brief Analysis**

The program file of the feature is located at:

`~/ros2_ws/src/example/example/mediapipe_example/hand_gesture.py`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image49.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

> **Before modifying the program, be sure to back up the original factory program. Do not modify the source code files directly. Incorrect parameter changes may cause the robot to behave abnormally and become irreparable!**

Based on the effects of the feature, the process logic has been outlined as shown in the diagram below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image50.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

As shown in the figure above, this feature works by capturing images through the **camera** and performing **preprocessing** on them. The preprocessing includes **converting the color space** to facilitate recognition. **Key points of the hand** are then extracted from the processed images. Different gestures are identified through logical analysis, such as calculating angles between key points. Finally, the **gesture trajectory** is drawn on the live camera feed.

The flowchart below outlines the logic of the program based on this file.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image51.png" class="common_img"/>

From the figure above, the program's logical flow is mainly divided into the initialization functions and the recognition processing functions, with important parts marked by a star. The following documentation is organized according to this program flowchart.

**1. Functions**

`main`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image52.png" class="common_img"/>

The main function is used to start the fingertip trajectory recognition node.

`get_hand_landmarks`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image53.png" class="common_img"/>

Converts the normalized data from MediaPipe into pixel coordinates.

`hand_angle`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image54.png" class="common_img"/>

After extracting the hand landmarks into the `results` variable, the landmarks need to be logically processed to determine the type of each finger, such as thumb or index finger. The `hand_angle` function takes the `landmarks(results)` collection as input and calculates the angles between the key points using the `vector_2d_angle` function. The elements of the `landmarks` collection correspond to the key points shown in the figure below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image55.png" class="common_img"/>

Taking the thumb as an example, the `vector_2d_angle` function is used to calculate the angles between its joints. The keypoints `landmarks[3]`, `landmarks[4]`, `landmarks[0]`, and `landmarks[2]` correspond to points 3, 4, 0, and 2 in the hand keypoint diagram. By calculating the angles formed by these joint points at the fingertip, the posture features of the thumb can be determined. The processing logic for the joints of the other fingers is similar.

To ensure accurate recognition, the parameters and basic logic of angle addition and subtraction in the hand_angle function can be kept at their **default settings**.

`h_gesture`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image56.png" class="common_img"/>

After identifying the types of fingers on the hand and determining their positions in the image, different gestures can be recognized by implementing the `h_gesture` function.

In the example `h_gesture` function shown above, the parameters `thr_angle = 65`, `thr_angle_thenum = 53`, and `thr_angle_s = 49` are the angle thresholds used to determine the gesture logic points. These values were chosen based on testing, as recognition is most stable at these settings. It is not recommended to change them. If the recognition results are unsatisfactory, adjustments within ±5 degrees are acceptable. The `angle_list[0,1,2,3,4]` corresponds to the types of the five fingers of the hand.

Taking the `"one"` gesture as an example:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image57.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

The code above shows the logic for recognizing the `"one"` gesture based on finger angles. `angle_list[0] > 5` checks whether the thumb's joint angle in the image is greater than 5. `angle_list[1] < thr_angle_s` checks whether the index finger's joint angle is smaller than the preset threshold `thr_angle_s. angle_list[2] < thr_angle` checks whether the middle finger's joint angle is smaller than the preset threshold thr_angle. The remaining two fingers, `angle_list[3] and angle_list[4]`, are processed using similar logic. When all these conditions are met, the current hand gesture is recognized as `"one"`. The recognition of other gestures follows a similar approach.

Each gesture has its own logic, but the overall framework is largely the same, and other gestures can be referenced based on this method.

`draw_points`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image58.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

Draw the currently detected hand shape along with all its key points.

**2. Class**

`State`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image59.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

An enumeration class used to represent the current state of the program.

`HandGestureNode`:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image60.png" class="common_img"/>

`HandGestureNode` is the fingertip trajectory recognition node. It contains three functions: an initialization function, a `main` function, and an image callback function. The `init` function initializes all required components and calls the camera node.

### 8.3.9 Body Gesture Control

Using the human pose estimation model trained with the MediaPipe machine learning framework, the system detects the human pose in the camera feed and marks the relevant joint positions. Based on this, multiple actions can be recognized in sequence, allowing direct control of the robot through body gestures.

From the robot's first-person perspective:  
Raising the left arm causes the robot to move a certain distance to the right. Raising the right arm causes the robot to move a certain distance to the left. Raising the left leg causes the robot to move forward a certain distance. Raising the right leg causes the robot to move backward a certain distance.

* **Program Introduction**

First, the MediaPipe human pose estimation model is imported, and the camera feed is accessed by subscribing to the relevant topic messages.

MediaPipe is an open-source framework designed for building multimedia machine learning pipelines. It supports cross-platform deployment on mobile devices, desktops, and servers, and can leverage mobile GPU acceleration. It also supports inference engines for TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite.

Next, using the constructed model, key points of the human torso are detected in the camera feed. These key points are connected to visualize the torso, allowing the system to determine the body posture.

Finally, if the user performs a specific action, the robot responds accordingly.

* **Operation Steps**

* **Project Outcome**

After starting the feature, stand within the camera's field of view. When a human body is detected, the returned video feed will display the key points of the torso along with lines connecting them.

From the robot's first-person perspective, raising the left arm causes the robot to turn left, raising the right arm causes the robot to turn right, raising the left leg causes the robot to move forward, and raising the right leg causes the robot to move backward.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image62.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

* **Program Brief Analysis**

The program file of the feature is located at:

`~/ros2_ws/src/example/example/body_control/include/body_control.py`

Based on the effects of the feature, the process logic has been outlined as shown in the diagram below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image64.png" class="common_img"/>

By capturing images through the camera and performing demonstration actions, the car executes the corresponding movements. From the robot's first-person perspective, raising the left arm makes the robot turn left, raising the right arm makes the robot turn right, raising the left leg makes the robot move forward, and raising the right leg makes the robot move backward.

The flowchart below outlines the logic of the program based on this file.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image65.png" class="common_img"/>

The initialization function `__init__(self.name)` defines the relevant parameters, including the definition of the image tool object `self.drawing`, which is used to draw the detected feature points, as well as the body detection object `self.body_detector`. After that, logical recognition is performed on the detected feature points. The output results are processed by applying conditions based on the distances between key points. The detected actions are stored, and the final output is sent to the car, enabling it to perform the corresponding movement.

### 8.3.10 Body Gesture Control with RGB Fusion

The depth camera is fused with RGB, allowing the system to perform both color recognition and body-gesture control. Based on the section [8.3.9 Body Gesture Control](#anchor_8_3_9) in this document, this session incorporates color recognition to determine the control target. Only when a person wearing a specified color is detected, which can be set through color calibration, their body gestures can be used to control the robot.

If a person wearing the specified color is not detected, the robot cannot be controlled. This allows precise targeting of the person who can control the robot.

* **Program Introduction**

First, the MediaPipe human pose estimation model is imported, and the camera feed is accessed by subscribing to the relevant topic messages.

Next, based on the constructed model, the key points of the human torso in the camera feed are detected, and lines are drawn between the key points to visualize the torso and determine the body posture. The center of the body is calculated based on all key points.

Finally, if the detected posture is "hands on hips," the system uses the clothing color to identify the control target, and the robot enters control mode. When the person performs specific gestures, the robot responds accordingly.

* **Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **When entering commands, be sure to use correct case and spacing. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.**

1. Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC. For detail informations, please refer to [1.4 Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/1_LanderPi_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration).

2. Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image6.png" style="width:30px"/> in the system desktop to open a ROS2 command-line window.

3. Enter the command to disable the app auto-start service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

4. Enter the following command and press **Enter** to start the feature.

```
ros2 launch example body_and_rgb_control.launch.py
```

5)  To exit this feature, press the **Esc** key in the image window to close the camera feed.

6)  To exit the feature, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal. If the program does not close successfully, try pressing **Ctrl + C** again.

* **Project Outcome**

After starting the feature, stand within the camera's field of view. When a person is detected, the camera feed will display the torso key points, lines connecting the points, and the body's center point.

Step 1: Adjust the camera slightly higher and maintain a certain distance so that the full body can be captured.

Step 2: When the person to be controlled appears in the camera feed, pose with hands on hips. If the buzzer beeps briefly once, the robot completes the calibration of the body center and clothing color and enters control mode.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image78.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

Step 3: From the robot's first-person perspective, performing specific gestures causes the robot to move accordingly. Raise the left arm to control the robot moving to the right, and raise the right arm to control the robot moving to the left.

Raise the left leg to control the robot moving forward, and raise the right leg to control the robot moving backward.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image79.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

Step 4: If a person wearing a different color enters the camera's field of view, they will not be able to control the robot.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image80.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

* **Program Brief Analysis**

The program file of the feature is located at:

`~/ros2_ws/src/example/example/body_control/include/body_and_rgb_control.py`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image81.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Before modifying the program, be sure to back up the original factory program. Do not modify the source code files directly. Incorrect parameter changes may cause the robot to behave abnormally and become irreparable!**

Based on the effects of the feature, the process logic has been outlined as shown in the diagram below:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image82.png" style="width:250px" class="common_img"/>

The camera captures the live feed to detect the body's key points. First, the system checks for a hands-on-hips pose. Then, it verifies the person by clothing color to ensure the same individual is being tracked. If confirmed, it monitors specific body gestures, such as raising the left arm, right arm, left leg, or right leg, to make the robot move accordingly. If the person does not match, the system resumes key point detection.

The flowchart below outlines the logic of the program based on this file.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image83.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

As shown in the figure above, the program first initializes the `BodyControlNode` class, setting default parameters, including the definition of the drawing tool object, the body detection object, and the initialization of pose states and counting parameters. The program then processes the incoming images. It first detects and outputs key body landmarks, calculates joint angles (e.g., for the arms) to calibrate the "hands-on-hips" pose, and performs color matching on the detected key points to determine whether the person has been previously calibrated. Finally, it monitors demonstration actions to control the robot's movement, such as raising arms or legs.

### 8.3.11 Human Pose Detection

In this program, human pose estimation model from the MediaPipe machine learning framework is used to detect human poses. When the robot detects a person has fallen, it will trigger an alert and perform a left-right twisting motion.

* **Program Introduction**

First, the MediaPipe human pose estimation model is imported, and the camera feed is accessed by subscribing to the relevant topic messages.

Next, the image is flipped and processed to detect human body information within the frame. Based on the connections between human keypoints, the system calculates the body height to determine body movements.

Finally, if a **fall** is detected, the robot will trigger an alert and move forward and backward.

* **Operation Steps**

## 8.4 Autonomous Driving

<p id="anchor_8_4_1"></p>

### 8.4.1 Map Layout and Course Props Installation

* **Overview**

This document is prepared for the autonomous driving feature of Hiwonder's robots. Before executing the autonomous driving feature, ensure that the hardwares installed on the robot, including depth camera and chassis motors, meet the required specifications and are functioning properly, and that the battery is fully charged.

* **Field Setup and Notes**

Before starting the autonomous driving feature, the environment needs to be set up properly. The detailed setup steps are as follows.

**1. Setup Steps**

(1) Map Layout

First, lay out the map on a flat and spacious surface, ensuring that the surrounding lighting is sufficient, as shown below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image4.jpeg" style="width:450px" class="common_img"/>

Place the robot at the starting point. During movement, the robot will follow the yellow line around the perimeter of the map for line following, and it can adjust its posture in real-time according to the lane markings.

(2) Traffic Signs Placement

For the autonomous driving feature, a total of four traffic signs need to be placed: two for going straight, one for right turn, and one for stop. The specific placement and the initial position of the robot can be referred to in the diagram below. Note: placement must be accurate!

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image5.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

Go straight: instructs the robot to move forward.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image6.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image7.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

Turn right: instructs the robot to turn right.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image8.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

Stop: instructs the robot to enter a stop state.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image9.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

The traffic signs provide guidance to the robot during its drive. Upon recognizing a traffic sign, the robot will perform the corresponding action. Additionally, when approaching a pedestrian crosswalk, the robot will slow down.

(3) Traffic Light Placement

In the autonomous driving feature, one traffic light needs to be placed at the specified position shown in the figure.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image10.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

The traffic light simulates real-world traffic signals. When the vehicle detects the traffic light, it will follow the stop at red, go at green rule.

Once all required items are placed, the scene should look like the figure below. You can use it as a reference to set up the environment.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.1/media/image11.jpeg" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

> [!NOTE]
>
> * **Ensure the area is well-lit with normal ambient lighting. Avoid strong direct light or colored lighting, as these may affect overall recognition performance.**
>
> * **During setup and use, take care of the course markers. If any parts of the map, traffic signs, or traffic light become damaged or unusable, please contact customer support to purchase replacements to avoid affecting recognition performance.**

### 8.4.2 Autonomous Driving

* **Lane Keeping**

This lesson focuses on controlling the car to move forward while keeping it within the lane.

**1. Preparation**

(1) Before starting, lay out the map on a flat surface, ensuring it is smooth with no wrinkles and that the road is free of obstacles. For detailed instructions on map setup, refer to [8.4.1 Map Layout and Course Props Installation](#anchor_8_4_1) in this document. Since this lesson only covers basic lane-following, there is no need to place traffic lights or signs.

(2) When performing this activity, make sure the environment is well-lit, but avoid direct light hitting the camera to prevent misrecognition.

(3) Adjust the color thresholds in advance to correctly detect the yellow lines, preventing misdetection during the lesson. For guidance on setting color thresholds, see [7. ROS+OpenCV Course](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/7_ROS%2BOpenCV.html).

(4) It is recommended to position the robot in the center of the lane for easier detection.

**2. Working Principle**

Lane keeping can be divided into three main parts: capturing real-time images, image processing, and result comparison.

First, real-time images are captured using the camera.

Next, the images are processed. This includes color detection, converting the detected images into a suitable color space, applying erosion and dilation, and performing binarization.

Finally, the processed images are analyzed. The region of interest (ROI) is extracted, contours are identified, and comparisons are made to determine the car's position relative to the lane.

Based on the comparison results, the forward direction is adjusted to keep the robot centered in the lane.

**3. Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **When entering commands, be sure to use correct case and spacing. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.**

* **Autonomous Parking**

This section demonstrates how to detect and recognize parking signs through command instructions.

**1. Preparation**

(1) Before starting, make sure to lay out the map properly, ensuring it is flat without wrinkles and that the road is clear of obstacles. For detailed instructions on map setup, refer to the section [8.4.1Map Layout and Course Props Installation](#anchor_8_4_1) in this document.

(2) The traffic sign detection model used in this lesson is a YOLOv8-trained model. For more information on YOLOv8, you can refer to [8.1 Machine Learning Basics](#anchor_8_1).

(3) When performing this feature, make sure the environment is well-lit, but avoid direct light hitting the camera to prevent misrecognition.

**2. Project Process**

First, capture the real-time video from the camera and perform image processing operations such as erosion and dilation.

Next, use YOLOv8 to run the model and compare the processed image with the target objects.

Finally, based on the comparison results, the robot recognizes the parking sign and automatically parks in the designated spot.

**3. Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> * **The following steps only enable parking signs detection in the camera feed and will not trigger the corresponding robot actions. To directly experience the autonomous driving feature, you can skip this lesson and refer to the section [Comprehensive Application of Autonomous Driving](#anchor_c_a_o_a_d) in this document.**

```

(3) Open the source code of the feature:

```
vim self_driving.py
```

(4) Press the **i** key to enter edit mode, then locate the highlighted code.

By modifying the parameters inside the red box, you can control where the robot begins the parking operation. Decreasing the parameter value will make the robot stop closer to the crosswalk, while increasing it will make the robot stop farther from the crosswalk. After editing, press **Esc**, type the command `:wq`, and press **Enter** to save and exit.

You can modify the parking function to adjust the robot's parking position. In this process, the robot is first set to move along the negative Y-axis to its right side at a linear velocity of 0.2 m/s for (0.38/2) seconds, moving to the left side of the parking spot. By changing the velocity and time values, you can fine-tune the robot's stopping position.

* **Comprehensive Application of Autonomous Driving**

This section demonstrates the comprehensive autonomous driving functionality of the robot through commands. It integrates multiple features, including lane keeping, traffic sign detection, traffic light recognition, turning decision making, and autonomous parking.

**1. Preparation**

**(1) Map Preparation**

The map should be laid on a flat surface, ensuring it is smooth without wrinkles, and that the road is clear of any obstacles. All road signs and traffic lights must be placed at the designated positions on the map, facing clockwise along the route. The positions of the road signs and the starting point are shown in the figure below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.2/media/image34.png" style="width:400px" class="common_img"/>

**(2) Color Threshold Setting**

Since lighting conditions affect color recognition, you need to adjust the thresholds for black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow before starting, following the instructions in [7. ROS + OpenCV Course](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/7_ROS%2BOpenCV.html).

If the robot fails to recognize colors correctly during operation, you should re-adjust the color thresholds in the problematic area of the map.

**2. Project Process**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.2/media/image35.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

The robot is currently capable of performing the following actions:

(1) Following the outer yellow line of the map.

(2) Slowing down when crossing a crosswalk.

(3) Turning when a turn sign is detected.

(4) Parking when a stop sign is detected.

(5) Stopping at red lights.

(6) Slowing down when a streetlight is detected.

First, load the YOLOv8-trained model file along with the required libraries, and obtain the real-time video feed from the camera. The input image is pre-processed using erosion, dilation, and other operations.

Next, detect the target color line in the image, and extract key information such as the size and center point of the detected region. Then, apply the YOLOv8 model to compare the processed image with the target dataset.

Finally, calculate the offset of the target center point, and adjust the robot's heading accordingly to keep it aligned in the middle of the road. During navigation, the robot also executes specific actions based on the detected traffic signs.

The source code for this program is located at:

`/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/example/example/self_driving/self_driving.py`

**3. Operation Steps**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **When entering commands, be sure to use correct case and spacing. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.**

Power on the robot and connect it to a remote control tool like VNC. For detail informations, please refer to [1.4 Development Environment Setup and Configuration](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/1_LanderPi_User_Manual.html#development-environment-setup-and-configuration).

(1) Click the terminal icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.2/media/image3.png" style="width:30px"/> in the system desktop to open a command-line window.

(2) Enter the following command and press **Enter** to stop the app auto-start service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(3) In the terminal, enter the following command and press **Ente**r:

```
ros2 launch example self_driving.launch.py
```

(4) To close the program, select the corresponding terminal window and press **Ctrl + C**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.2/media/image37.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

**4. Function Outcome**

**① Lane Keeping**

After the program is started, the robot follows the yellow line at the edge of the road. Depending on whether the yellow line is straight or curved, it will move forward or turn accordingly to stay within the lane.

**② Traffic Light Recognition**

When encountering a traffic light, the robot will stop if the light is red and move forward if the light is green. When crossing a crosswalk, the robot will automatically reduce its speed and proceed slowly.

**③ Turn Signs and Parking Signs**

While moving forward, if the robot detects a traffic sign, it will take the corresponding action. If a right-turn sign is detected, the robot will turn right and continue moving forward. If a parking sign is detected, the robot will perform parallel parking.

Following these rules, the robot continuously navigates around the map in a loop.

* **FAQ**

1\. The robot performs poorly during line-following, moving in a wobbly manner.

Adjust the color thresholds according to the actual lighting environment. For detailed instructions, refer to [7. ROS + OpenCV Course](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/7_ROS%2BOpenCV.html).

2\. The robot's turning radius is too large or too small.

\(1\) Check whether the robotic arm offset is properly calibrated. For calibration steps, see [9.1 Robotic Arm Basic Control](https://wiki.hiwonder.com/projects/LanderPi/en/latest/docs/9_Robotic_Arm_Basic_Control.html#robotic-arm-basic-control).

\(2\) Modify the line-following processing code:

Enter the command to navigate to the program directory:

```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/example/example/self_driving/
```

Enter the command to open the program:

```
vim self_driving.py
```

The highlighted value represents the lane center point. Decreasing the value makes the robot turn earlier, while increasing it delays the turn.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_4.2/media/image55.png" style="width:500px" class="common_img"/>

3\. Parking position is inaccurate.

You can modify the parking function or adjust the starting point of the parking operation. For details, see [Parameter Adjustment](#anchor_parameter_adjustment) in the section **Autonomous Parking**.

4. Traffic sign recognition is inaccurate.

Adjust the detection confidence level. For details, see [Operation Steps](#operation_steps_17) in the section **Traffic Sign Detection**.
